- 1 - What will your software do? 

My software will encrypt messages just like WhatsApp does by using a system of people having a key and sharing them
with one another.

- 1.1 - What features will it have?

I'll let the user choose multiple encryption methods, this will make it more secure and reliable. 
Only the user will have its password that he could share with another user.

- 1.2 How will it be executed?

Mainly by creating a database that would only hold a username and a password, could use Supabase for that
or a simple MongoDb cluster.

- 2- What new skills will you need to acquire? 

For this one, mainly how cryptography works on message exchanging.

- 2.1 - What topics will you need to research?

I'll also have to research about the recommended cases on how to store or handle each user.

- 3- If working with one or two classmates, who will do what?

Will do by myself.

- 4 - In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it’s not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope. What might you consider to be a good outcome for your project? A better outcome? The best outcome?

The best outcome for this would be an app that could at least:
Log in/Register the user
Let the user choose its encryption method
Let the user change his password to a maximum of a 12-letter word
